# Currency Converter

The United Nations currently recognizes 180 currencies that are used in 195 countries across the world. Since many of these countries have different currencies, it is often difficult to recognize how much one needs to pay when they are travelling overseas to a country that uses a different currency than their own. As a result, many people end up paying far more than they should for different expenses.

We were inspired to help these people because we believe that everyone should be able to know how much they pay for.

### What our app does
By using android studio, we were able to develop an app that allows people to scan images of price tags from anywhere in the world, and it is able to convert these prices into different currencies.
